    <p>
      Mango float is a popular dessert in the Philippines. It is a no-bake cake
      made with layers of graham crackers, whipped cream, condensed milk, and
      ripe mangoes.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make sure your mangos are ripe and sweet. Peel the skin and slice mangos
        thinly or you can chop the mangos. Set aside.
      </li>

        Whip heavy cream until soft peaks form. Then gradually add pinch of salt
        and condensed milk. Whip cream until stiff peaks form. Tip: chill the
        heavy cream, condensed milk, and bowl in the fridge for a few hours or
        overnight for easy whipped cream!

        Crush graham crackers until desired crumb or use the whole cracker
        without crushing. I like it crushed for a soft crumble texture.Let’s
        start layering the mango float in a 8 x 8 inch glass container or a
        large container. First lay the graham crackers. Then, whipped cream.
        Lastly, add sliced mango. Repeat one more time. For the last layer, add
        whipped cream and sliced mango. You can also add more graham cracker
        crumbs at the top for decoration.

        Cover the container and refrigerate overnight. Served chilled for soft
        texture (like bread pudding). Another option is to freeze overnight for
        ice cream like texture. Before eating, thaw for 30 minutes or less
        depending on what texture you like.
